# Road Fighter

A game where the player drives in the top down mode. This includes fuel meter, score and speed.

# Explanations

## Observer patterns

The health bar will be listening for the signal from `Car` class to see the fuel.

## Event patters

The car stops once the fuel is empty.

# Evaluation

Could've done a better job with planning up ahead. Showed up at class late, need to be on time.
Forgot to add state patterns. Observer pattern used in engine commands. I learnt `signals` in godot on the go.
